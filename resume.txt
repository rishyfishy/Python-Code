Experience

Hyperloop Braking Subsystem              October 2019 to January 2020
Lead Mechanical Designer
Developed pneumatic braking system from scratch for SpaceX Competition.
Taught all new members how to use SolidWorks at the CSWA Level.
 Designed components for energy and structures subsystems.

Human Powered Vehicle Design Team        April 2020 to January 2020 
Sponsorship Director 
Expanded the teams sponsor network to acquire valuable resources.
Helped get over 10,000 in sponsorships for the team.
Spearheaded 4 workshops on advanced tools in SolidWorks and 			workflow optimization tips to improve CAD speed by over 300

Microcellular Plastics Manufacturing Lab       May 2020 to August 2020
Research Assistant
Created PVDF samples using compression molding and batch foaming.
Analyzed material samples using DSC and other technologies. 
Wrote a 10,000word paper on BN nanocomposites with 160 references.

Human Powered Vehicle Design Team          September 2019 to April 2020
Lead Structural Designer
Designed vehicle frame for ASME Challenge and world speed record.
Used advanced surface modeling and FEA to double the safety factor.
Got handson experience with machining and carbon fiber layups. 


Projects
Traffic Sign Recognition 
Designed a convolutional neural network using Pytorch to recognize German traffic signs in a variety of lighting conditions. Optimized model hyperparameters, achieving a test accuracy of 97 

CPU Transient Thermal Simulation
Simulated heat transfer through CPU IHS with and without an external heatsink in SolidWorks. Compared results to show the importance of good thermal management. 

CNC Machine
Designed a CNC mill from scratch using Solidworks.	Reduced costs by 40 through design iteration and conducting part selection, considering manufacturability and cost effectiveness. Link to report

Injection Moldable Drawer Guides
Modeled and 3D printed replacement drawer hardware, optimized with topology optimization, reducing weight by about 50. Now my moms drawers are fixed. As a design study, I modified the part for injection molding and made molds.
